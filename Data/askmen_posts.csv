4,xv3ta4,How do I know if I'm being a pushover or not?,"I'm a male 27 and sometimes I find myself in social situations where I look back and think ""man, that person was being subtly disrespectful and/or a smartass and I let it slide. I should have said something"".

Like as an example, the other day I was craving a cigarette but I'm not a daily smoker. So I walked up to these guys on the street and offered $1 for a smoke. One of the guys said ""no, but you can buy a pack right there"" with a full pack in his hand... And pointed to the corner store. It caught me off guard a bit and I just said alright no problem and walked away.

Was it disrespectful? Not really, but the delivery was a bit smart, and often times I don't want to escalate so I find myself giving a smirk and walking away.

Another time I was at the bar and was talking to these military guys. I made a common joke that navy guys are gay and the guy took it too literally. He said something like ""well I know guys that actually do stuff and aren't weekend warriors, so watch what you say about the navy"" (I'm in the national guard). The guy was in the Space Force lol, I just smirked and said ""alright, have a good one"" and left the situation.

Was he disrespectful? Not necessarily, but his answer was a little cheeky and I oftentimes find myself just walking away and feel like a beta male. I've been in my fair share of arguments and fights and I don't like to escalate stuff so I just walk away a lot of the times.

Sometimes people are just dry and give smart answers if they feel annoyed, even if I'm not intending it to be annoying and just trying to be friendly.

How do I ask for respect without blowing little things out of proportion?",1664853169,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/xv3ta4/how_do_i_know_if_im_being_a_pushover_or_not/,askmen

23,xv1n4z,What's the worst/cringiest attempt a woman has made to flirt with you?,"I'll start. This happened a few days ago so it's fresh in my mind. I was in a supermarket and walking down the soft drink aisle which was totally empty. I stop where the drinks I want are and this woman walks around me from the back and stands next to me (so she'd followed me down the aisle). Then after a couple of seconds she starts loudly talking about how they never have what she wants in stock, but at this point I'm trying to play it off like she's talking on her phone or something and not to me. Then she turns and says excuse me and that's when I look at her properly for the first time. She's at least 10 years older than me (I'm in my late 20s), brunette, about 5'9 (so not short, which will be relevant in a sec) and definitely not talking on the phone. Not bad looking by any means but definitely not who I'd be interested in. After saying excuse me she asks if I can grab her down one of the bottles from the top shelf because she's ""a shortass"" (her words, and she said it with conviction too which made it sillier in retrospect), which are the same bottles as the one on the next shelf down...which she easily could have reached. At this point though I just want out of this awkward interaction though so I grab a bottle and hand it to her. She says thanks, I say that's alright and think that's going to be it and start turning around to walk off. But then she puts her hand on my arm and starts rubbing it, and says ""I bet you're strong"". Welp now I'm officially over it, so I keep turning and start walking back down the aisle away from her. Thinking to myself ""lady it was just a 2L bottle of coke, it's not hard to lift it"". I even went to the checkouts and paid for what I'd gotten so far then drove to another supermarket to finish shopping just so I didn't have to run into her again, I got no interest in being her boy toy and she just couldn't seem to take a hint that I wasn't interested in her.

35,xuzz0f,Why is my little girl afraid of the dog?,"
My friend has two dogs, a 150 pound great Dane, and a 250 pound English mastiff. when we go over to visit and the dogs come out to greet us, my 4Y/O little girl gets really scared and wants me to pick her up. 

Anytime the dogs start running or barking my kiddo gets scared, my daughter is a little more scared of the mastiff, but still pretty scare of the dane. Why is she doing this? The dogs haven't done anything to her. When the dogs are out of sight she is fine.

Of course I will listen to my daughter and put the dogs away. I just don't understand why she's acting this way.

Also, my daughter loves dogs. We have a border collie at home and they love each other, how come she is so terrified of these dogs? Is the kid just doing
this on purpose to get attention?

The border collie is a good 20 pounds heavier than my daughter and a little bit taller than her too. And from day one they have loved each other, and she was not hesitant whatsoever when they were meeting. So even though the collie  is a tiny bit bigger and heavier than her, she didn’t like that scare her?

86,xusybm,Want Your Son(s) To Know How To Treat Women &amp; Girls As Human Beings With Agency? Here’s How,"I don’t know if there are men posting here and how many men post here, but I am saying this as a Black woman who doesn’t have anyone of the male perspective to interact with.
If you have a son or sons, please teach them that:
Women are to be a man’s equal and girls are to be equal to boys.
Show them that girls/women can do the same occupations as them and if you introduce them to someone who chooses/chose not to, it is a personal choice as women/girls are supposed to have agency.
Teach them that their bodies belong to them and no one else aka bodily autonomy.
Teach them no man can/should control a woman and vice versa.
Teach your son or sons that it is fine to show outward emotions beyond the default emotion of anger.
Teach them that they should not be ashamed of their emotions as emotions make them human.
Teach them, upon adolescence, that they are not their genitalia size as that is only a small part of their masculinity.
Teach them around that same developmental time that they are not God’s gift to girls, and later, women.
Teach them it is not a man’s/boy’s world, but help them make at least their personal world one where boys and girls can socialize w/one another w/o fear of each other.
If they are non-White, teach them age appropriately about the hostility they will encounter just for existing.
If they are White, teach them that they are not to atone for the societal sins of their Fathers Forefathers and Mother’s Foremothers, but teach them to leave the world better than how they found it regarding treatment of those who are “othered” in society (everyone who is not cis, White and male).",1664825381,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/xusybm/want_your_sons_to_know_how_to_treat_women_girls/,askmen

Meanwhile, a lot of women I know (I being one) admit they sleep in often or just prefer it. If we do wake up early it’s often out of necessity. This is not always the case, but I see it less with dudes.

I am not from the USA, and when I first moved here guys would say I am scary. I used to think it’s a joke and I would laugh about it, but after being told so many times and starting to try and date I have started to think it’s not a joke anymore. I’ve had guys have a “freeze” response when in simple arguments, men larger than me would check my car glove box to make sure I don’t have a gun in there, and men much bigger than me straight out say “you are scary” and getting upset when I’d take it as a joke because they felt invalidated. 

Before it was funny, but I’ve started to get offended now. I don’t look weird and I’m conventionally attractive, so it has to be my personality. Is there things that make men be intimidated even by women that are much smaller? It makes no sense, unless they are like that or assume things because of my Eastern European accent.

I'm not sure how he was able to draw those two other observations from my answers, maybe because I said I think SSRIs might help me if I take them. 

Anyways, he told me that he knows me better than I know myself, which I disagreed because he's only known me for 1 year.

An ex-colleague invited me to a party of the company and he was there. We did not speak, but he offered shots to our table once 😅. After i came home, i sent him an Instagram request ( as most of my ex-colleagues have him on Insta). He accepted and followed back. I really want to start a convo, and invite him for a coffee.

145,xuji34,how does the audible subscription works?,"For some reason I thought it works something like Spotify or Netflix where you get access to their content library where you can listen to whatever you want as long as you're paying the subscription fee. 

I thought this because in the FAQ they say that you will get access to all the books marked with the tag 'included'. 

However when I started the trial for the premium account I got one credit a month and this only allows me access to a single book. As far as I understand it, all I get from my subscription is one credit per month meaning that $15 monthly subscription buys you one book a month. And you can only listen to the books you bought. 

And the 'included' tag only means books that you can buy with the $15 a month credit. Meaning that if the book is not included you can't buy it with the $15 a month credit you earn you only can buy it with actual money.

And after the subscription runs out you will no longer have access to the books you bought with credits.

My boyfriend and I have only been together for 3 months but we’ve known each other for more than 2 years, and have been in love about a year. We put off being together for a while due to circumstances. We cut off contact for 5 months but when we saw each other again (we work together) it was like everything came back to us. All the feelings and sht like that.

We officially got together in July, but while we were together, his ex would always be around blackmailing him, threatening to su*cide if he doesnt take her back so he couldnt completely cut her off, afraid that she might actually do it.

Fast forward to this weekend, my boyfriend admitted that his ex came to him a few weeks ago telling him she is about ~5 months pregnant. Timeline wise is accurate cos they were still together then. 

Obviously he took her back as his responsibility but neither one of us wanted to call our relationship off, if it weren’t for the baby.

I know yall are going to scream at me for even going here to post this but I really want him. I know I’m gonna have to share a lot specially with his ex and the baby but I’m all for it. I dont know how to bring it up to him, or if I should even.

He also asks me questions about marriage (when I want to get married, what I look for in a guy), 

We were doing manoeuvres and he moved the steering wheel to help me out whilst I just had my foot on the gas and then said something along the lines of “see this is how good I am, this is why you should trust me, I’m driving from the passenger seat”, I said he’s a good instructor and he said woahh this is the first time you’ve ever complimented me.  He also always offers me sweets and offers to stop and buy me a drink to “wake me up” 

Last lesson I made an effort to dress up, and he complimented me and said I look smart, and asked if I’m going anywhere… 

He’s only a few years older than me, from the same religion/culture as me, lives a street away from me, we get along really well, I feel like he likes me (but when I first started my lessons I had a bf so I was reserved, I’ve only opened up with him now, maybe thats why he put his hand over me?)

On the other hand, ignoring seems like the only other feasible action. If I write back something like 'Do not contact me', again they know they got a rise out of me.

For context, I've known this girl for around 5 months. We worked at the same part-time job the summer after highschool.

We kept talking after I moved away to college(she's staying for community college), but recently she's been taking a really long time to respond now(though I think it's cause shes busy cause she always responds at 3 in the morning). I'm going back home for the winter and will be working at the same part time job with her again, and figured that if I still hadn't gotten over her at that point and she hadn't ghosted me, I'd ask her out to a movie or concert or something. The problem is I'm completely infatuated with her, to the point where I don't even think about other girls at college and I spend every waking moment thinking about her.

203,xu8m2f,How do I [f28] flirt with a shy friend [m26] who’s been long term friend zoned?,"I have a friend I’m into, but never pursued because he never seemed to show an interest that way and acted like more of a brother to me. We’ve been friends for over 10 years now but never met in person, and grew a bit distant but still talk.  

Whenever I try to flirt he goes quiet or changes topic, and as far as I know he has zero experience with women. Recently I found out he’s really shy and insecure, &amp; realised his lack of interest could be that. I know he’s insecure about his height too, and I am a lot taller than him. Retrospectively I’ve called him cute a lot which I know shorter guys can see as a negative. Aside from trying to flirt, I also shared and asked for selfies, ask about his life and plans a lot, compliment him, and we spend time together sometimes gaming. I’ve even told him I think he’s an attractive guy but I’m worried it came across as more of a ‘there there’ towards his insecurities as opposed to a confession.  

I’m not sure if he feels like he’s in the friend zone &amp; is oblivious or just doesn’t really like me that way. I’d say I’m moderately attractive but in what people call a ‘unique’ way - aka not everyone’s thing. I’ve also been called ‘intense’ a lot which I know can be intimidating.  

I don’t really want to lose his friendship or freak him out by being too suddenly forward, but I’m not sure how to flirt with a guy who doesn’t flirt back. Should I just take his behaviour as a lack of interest or try and be more straightforward?",1664768741,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/xu8m2f/how_do_i_f28_flirt_with_a_shy_friend_m26_whos/,askmen

223,xu6o1j,Does my husband watching porn mean he desires what I am not?,"I (F, 26) recently found my husbands (M, 25) Reddit porn account. I will admit I unlocked his phone, and immediately when I unlocked it, it was open to his Reddit porn account. From looking, it appears he has a normal account for everything else and account where he follows at least 50 porn pages. This account has been active for four years. I think it also hurt way more because I was asleep on the couch when he was viewing this, and he was right next to me. 

I shouldn’t have unlocked his phone, because I know you always find things you don’t want. And it is an invasion. But I feel crushed. I understand porn is fantasy, but I cannot stop thinking about it and thinking he wants something else than me. I have had self esteem issues I have been addressing in therapy on and off for years, and he is well aware of my fears and stress over not being good enough in multiple aspects of life. 

When I attempted to bring it up, I said a notification came up from one of the porn subs and I saw it. He denied it full force and then it began an argument of me blaming him for something that wasn’t him. He doesn’t know I actually opened the phone. 

I was totally wrong. But now I feel like I have opened the door to something I can’t get past right now without knowing he doesn’t want someone else.",1664763126,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/xu6o1j/does_my_husband_watching_porn_mean_he_desires/,askmen

I felt I needed to ask a group of individuals to try and find some perspective and insight on how to deal with the ongoing increase of day to day living. (This is not a finance post not asking how to get rich quick) But lately I've been finding it harder to stay above water, things getting closer to being paycheque to paycheque and savings rapidly decreasing. Its been taking an incredible toll on my mental well being, I feel in simplest terms burnt out. Like my hard work is going nowhere. How do you guys deal with these things? Emotionally and mentally. 

Im 31 years of age, no mortgage ( paid house in full ), 100k a year job, no loans, no car debt, no reckless spending. 

I do understand fully that I am in a great position here financially but over the past few years. Im going backwards. Is there a financial crisis that is on the way?

I told her that I didn’t want her to stop being friends with this person, just to please reconsider how much time they spent together. She said that she should be able to because I would prefer to not go and do things. Keep in mind, I still tried to make the effort to do something with her “adventurous” at least once a week.

For example, she would:
• Occasionally cook him and his roommate dinner.
• Join a sport team together 
• Get dinner together
• Watch a movie together
• Says she’d happily smoke weed with him

Her response was that she would not compromise and that it’s important to have friends and thinks I should be able to do the same. Was I being unreasonable / controlling?

290,xtzavh,How common is it too have temporary desires to want to be with other women in a long-term relationship?,"Even if your relationship is incredible and healthy, it’s…

- Deeply loving
- You plan a future with them (marriage/children)
- Value alignment (particularly on big topics such as children) 
- Balance each other’s weaknesses out 
- Great sex and intimacy 

Yet it’s challenging to escape the spontaneous curiosity and Q:

‘Is there another version of the relationship I’m in with an even more attractive 10/10 woman?

It’s not obvious to me that we/I even need to be with a “drop dead gorgeous” woman and that one’s character and how you interact with each other is vastly more important. 

Yet I still cannot escape this desire and curiosity of what it would be like to sleep with and be in a relationship with essentially a more attractive and different physical version of my current relationship. 

A part of me justifies this as a natural consequence to modern monogamy and recognises most males have a primitive desire to procreate with as many women as they can.

With “women’s” style, if you want enough room to hold more than 6 cards you’ll end up with something the size of a small purse. Or the cutesy designs make it bulky; even the smallest wallets that hold 2 cards will barely fit in a bigger size pocket.

Fashion drives me insane. I just want efficiency. I want to have the option of having a stupid number of cards, space leftover, and for it to not be overly bulky. This is possible and more in “men’s” style wallets, and always has been, and this whole issue feels like a giant joke on me.

I typically do not care to break society norms for the sake of efficiency, or even my own comfort. But the amount of comments I have received over a simple black wallet is overwhelming!! The vast majority of complaints is that since I’m a woman attracted to men, men will see my bag (I carry a little blue fashion-y but still practical backpack instead of a purse) and a “men’s” wallet and assume I’m gay. Or if we’re on a first date and they see me with a “men’s” wallet they’ll instantly lose interest.

Today, after I had some post nut clarity, I did some reflecting on how I felt, and I realized when I was younger, jerking off felt great! I would nut, my body would shut down and turn into jello and I would feel so relieved + relaxed + feel a little high from it. But now, when I nut, I feel like I'm just relieving some pent up nut in my balls and that's about it. Feels good, but it's just not the same.

As for my girlfriend, she is really kind and funny, a little clumsy sometimes but she tries her best in everything she does.And has no problems sharing bed with me.

I mean most of us desire to have a baby but we choose to wait just because it's the most reasonable thing to do. On the other hand i've realized some men around me are planning to have a baby one day but i can't see any desire or emotional reaction about the thought of a baby. Like they don't feel anything. I once told this to my mom and she said dads usually startes to feel things after the baby born or at least when they can see the baby on the ultrasound etc. Is that right? How does it work for you?

So, for a little while now my girlfriend has had a not so pleasant odor down under. I did what I could, and we still had sex. Eventually I couldn’t do the smell anymore. It was just too much for me. It became an immediate turn off. We haven’t had sex for weeks. I am still incredibly attracted to her, and physically attracted to her. She’s my person and we are going to be married eventually. Tonight, she made a joke about sex and I didn’t acknowledge it, and she immediately was upset. I knew she had been upset for a while because she mentioned it before. And tonight was when I could really see how bad she was hurting. 

I hadn’t told her before because i didn’t know how to not upset her. I was very polite and kind when telling her, but now she is livid with me for not telling her sooner…

We have had two arguments (which is two more than we had before this), and it feels like the communication has been rough since. She hasnt initiated a single conversation in weeks, and the ones we have feel forced sometimes. I am realizing that there are things about her that I dont really like and struggle to put up with.  


But on the flip side, some days it feels really good. We are happy, and enjoying each others presents, and being goofy and silly and just having fun. We have plans for a big date in two weeks and I was so excited for it and had this great plan but now I dont even know what to think about it

More detail tl:dr

My adult son... it won't hurt him to reach out more than 2 holidays a year. Granted he is a Marine, and that ""family"" is a bit of a cult imho. The movies show Marines as close for life. Im here to tell you Marines dont form LTR even with each other very often. The reality of the military is constantly shuffling personnel and this results in poor relationship building; even as it demands fidelity.

Still, he could call his mother occassionally.  She is my ex and I talk more often with her then he does. She is pretty good person.

I think it is more than just ""he is busy as a Marine.""  I check in and get snarky replies. My dad and I did not see eye to eye. I talked with him every day. It was not even in my wheelhouse to ghost my parents.

559,xsx5m0,I (20m) cuddled with my friend (20f) last night. Was she flirting? What do you guys think?," 

Ive known her for about 5 years. We've always been sorta close but not tootoo close. Last night we were both working an overnight shift at a residential home. She was a little clingy at the start of the night, locking hands with me on a couple occasions and requesting I sit with her. This isn't out of character of her.

Halfway through the night we are sitting together on the couch watching netflix. She goes to crack her neck like you would your knuckles, which she knows is something that irks me. I go to grab one of her arms to stop her, and in response she grips my arm with both of hers tightly and we are sitting there cheek to cheek. She ends up falling asleep in that position, and I stay put because I don't want to wake her. I know she was asleep because im ngl I was feeling up her right hand and there was no response from her.

We toss and turn a couple of times whilst remaining in the same position, and eventually she wakes up at 3:30a and I decide to leave because I wasnt suppose to be there that late (My shift ended at 9p) and have work at 9am.

Was she flirting with me? Im not sure at all myself because Ive had a bad experience where there was a girl I liked who was very flirtatious and clingy yet they swore they were not and told me more than once that they did not like me back.

The girl in question is very smart, attractive and generally just my type. However, she is also the closest friend I have at the moment so Id prefer not to risk ruining that unless I know 100% that she does indeed like me back.

Not sure how much context this adds, if any, but im someone a lot of women find cute (been hearing this all my life) even though I dont think so at all and my self image is honestly really poor. but I do often find my self in these situations with my female friends where they are overly touchy and clingy to me.

I appreciate any help!",1664635666,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/xsx5m0/i_20m_cuddled_with_my_friend_20f_last_night_was/,askmen

But I’ve always been kind of interested in seeing what phases (of this nature) men go through? Specifically those who are/were part of the ‘popular guys’ in school. 

Firstly, why were you so affectionate with male friends? (Moaning on their laps, slapping their asses, making sexual jokes) 
Was it all a big joke or was it undiscovered queerness that was egged on by other participating friends? 

Secondly, what was your headspace like at the time? 
I can only speak from experience, as someone who went through a not like other girls phase: I seeked male approval through making myself look the best out of ‘every other girl’ because I ‘didn’t’ pay attention to societal norms. So what was being in that environment like? Were you always putting on an act? Was it all genuine? 

Did you make fun of the inevitable group of queer kids at school? If so, was it a sense of wanting to fit in? Doing everything in your power to make yourself feel normal? Or were you genuinely homophobic?

The problem is that I'm very insecure with my looks. She says that I look great but when I look at myself in the mirror, I feel ugly. Like my haircut is off. I have dark circles. I get tanned quite easily. I'm also bit hairy I guess. Her being so good with words make my insecurities worse. She always has something to talk about and is well-read. On the other hand, I'm just 😶 most of the time. I have nothing to talk about. You know, some people have this charming aura around them. She goes to the gym too😭. 

So, how do guys make yourself look good? Both physically and emotionally. Should I start reading books? What sort of books? Should I buy a perfume? Get an expensive haircut?

Recently it’s surfaced as a problem because I could be “in the mood” and he’s already taken care of himself or isn’t in the mood to take on such a task because doing it himself is easier. I caught him hiding in the bathroom “getting his fix” yesterday and the reality of the situation really set in. 
I always ignored the thought of it being an issue and labeled his habits as normal but even after reassurance, I still feel like he’s choosing to lust after these miscellaneous girls on the internet instead of wanting me. It’s really taking a toll on our relationship. 
Obviously this is only my side of the story and it’s a bad habit that he claims he wants to quit. He says it makes him feel gross and claims it’s really “not all that satisfying”. Now after much stress he’s asked me for help and support but I feel so lost and helpless on where to even start.

630,xsmu14,How do I make the most out of the few opportunities I get to talk to her?,"There's a girl at work. I've wanted to get to know her for a while, but the nature of our job has us rarely working directly together. Over the course of our time working there, we've had small, friendly exchanges. Sometimes I would get a feeling that she had some kind of interest in me, though she also just seems nice. But if she goes out of her way to compliment my appearance on a day I dress nicer than usual...

Well, anyway, a few days ago I had the opportunity to work directly with her all day. Pretty much right off the bat, she started making conversation. Asking all kinds of personal questions. I feel like we were both enjoying the interaction. There was a little bit of flirting, for sure. But at the end of the day, I didn't get a chance to cap it off with something like ""I enjoyed talking to you today"", and the next week brought pretty much all my momentum to a halt. She did greet me with a smile on Monday, we exchanged a little laugh another day...but the opportunities to really talk are rare if we're not working in close proximity, and at that point I feel awkward about trying to force a conversation to happen. I wouldn't even know what to say to make it worth the time. I've never had an issue talking to women, but that's if it happens organically. When we both have separate jobs to do and I don't even know if she actually wants to talk or was just being friendly...it's hard to try anything.

I'm sure some would say to just ask her out, but I've never been comfortable with doing that without at least some kind of foundation built. I don't want to wait long, but I also cannot use one day of friendly conversation as a green light to make a move. I want to get a better sense of what she thinks of me. It's just that I don't get many chances to find out. I need to make the most of those moments that I can actually talk to her.

3. What makes you most upset? 
4. When upset, do you have a way to cool down and organize your thoughts?
5. What's an experience that changed your perception of view? 
6. What's something you think you deserve? 
7. What's your mental and emotional health like right now? 
8. Who do you consider a mentor? To you, personally, what's the most important thing they've taught you?
9. Let's say you have a son, what advice would you share?
10. Let's say you have a daughter, what advice would you share?
11. Is finding a romantic partner important to you? Why or why not?

I have like zero interest in getting a girlfriend right now, sex and masturbation is completely robotic to me now. I don't do it because I want it, I do it because I feel like I have to.

752,xs1svd,"Have you ever chosen family time over work/more money, and why?","My boyfriend travels 85% of the week for his job. He complains about his job and he had opportunity to take a pay cut to be home more (and we could easily afford that), but turned it down because of the prestige of the company he works for and money. He has 2 kids 12, 13. They have had issues at school and personally. The son even said to him “how will you help, you are never here”. The 13yo daughter was just caught about to have sex in her room at moms house.  Bio mom is struggling as she has 3 others kids and her husband works all the time too. My bf will hold a family meeting, saying he will be around more, this time he wants to do a PowerPoint and then he will be only home part of a weekend and sees the kids for only a little time if at all. I have tried to encourage him to be more about family and he says he is and financially provides and gives the kids money to buy things and do sports activities including $2000 a year or more for competitive cheerleading. I have no kids and make a good living &amp; I already pay all our housing as he lives in the house I own. And I have told him I don’t care how much he earns we are a team and that family is the most important thing. I also don’t want him to feel like he can’t have a career that he enjoys or is proud of. But he takes my encouragement like I just want him to be my maintenance guy and work at target or something. I actually work in the field of career development and would never want to hinder him however I am concerned for his kids and I want the best for them. I also would like to see him more than just a couple days a week because I’m not in it for money I’m in it for a loving relationship, and he too has said how good we are together and we have fun. I am not out to control him and have decided on no longer going to do any encouragement. I spend time with the kids on a regular basis even when he is not here in addition to having my own life filled with friends in my own activities. I am just curious from a man’s point of view have you ever realized that you needed to make a change in your job and possibly make less money so you could be with your family more and what made you come to that decision.

756,xs1f2e,Men- tell me how to talk to you when there is an issue,"I am a woman and I don't have a significant other.  When issues come up and I have to deal with a man, many times(not all) I feel like I am being belittled.   This is only if I have an issue with some thing the man has done.  

For instance, my car was vandalized because a valet gave me the wrong instructions on where to park.  The manager of the valet blamed me over and over, and kept twisting the story around for it to be my fault.   This person argued with me via email for one whole weekend.   He just wouldn't admit that it was them at fault even though I already spoke to his boss and his boss compensated me for the damage.  Plus, it was all on camera.

Now today, the landscapers my landlord hired always blow leaves and dirt on my car and cause little dents that cause rust.   This is been going on for years.  Many times I've asked them to not do this, my window has even been smashed from these rocks.    Today, I nicely messaged the landscaper because I saw them doing it yet AGAIN.  I got nothing but attitude.  Then he started calling me ""honey"" Saying ""it's OK we'll take care of it honey"".   There's nothing they can do to take care of it, the damage is done it's just a matter of not doing it.   Yet he is flippant and saying maybe I should come out and take care of the lawn etc.  My landlord is kind of a shit and I've spoken to him about this several times before and it just keeps happening.  

My question is this: I feel like if I was a man or I had a man in my life my concerns would be taken seriously.    How do I get them to be respectful towards me or is there anyway?",1664544614,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/xs1f2e/men_tell_me_how_to_talk_to_you_when_there_is_an/,askmen

Give a 50/50 pool of woman to men, sure some woman might approach first.

but if add, woman don't want to be unwanted approach, a number of men would take that, and seek dating apps as a acceptable form, both parties agreeing.

but you still have a number of men that wont, and just approach in real world. doesn't matter if only 1/20 agree to a date, those first 20 already have a built expectation that THE man they hope might approach, or at least one they might accept a date will approach, why go to a dating app.

So at least option to go on a date is greater from the group that receiving the request, why go to a dating app when high change of just wait and see.

As for the men that think well how else do I approach for a date if asking randomly in the store is not wanted, well dating apps give clear indication that what they for.

As for historical data, ah but 2015 it was more equal. There still business fiddling that goes on, bot detection which might have gotten better, fake accounts purposefully created by these companies to keep one gender, the one I assume spends the most on extras to boost chances. Can through in novelty which boost early stage signing up.

794,xrt72w,"Girl shrug off weeks ago, seemed really interested when ran into her today. Asked availability, said she'll let me know when she's in the neighborhood for meeting again. What's next?","So I saw this girl on an event on her stall, made some quick talk, but was not at all confident when I asked her out, which she shrug me off saying she has a boyfriend. 

Worked on myself in the last couple of weeks, grooming, dressing, which helped me boost confidence, I believe, based on getting complimented by women in bars and also coworkers. 

Saw that same girl today at a cafe, she was eating alone. I recognized her and called her by name and said hello. She recognized my face, and was a little surprised that remembered her. I complimented her back saying I'm surprised that she remembers me, as she should have met so many people that day. 

To engage her in conversations, I asked her recommendations on the food items, and then asked her, if I could join. She accepted with a smile and so I sat along as well. 

This time, I was much confident and self aware.

The conversation went pretty smooth, when it was almost dimming, she was bringing it back in the same pace I was doing. Talked about career, family, hobbies etc. 

It was an asian cafe, and she's also an asian, so I said, since she suggested me some good asian food, I should suggest her some Indian food as well, adding that if she's here again, to let me know so that I can take her to that place. 

I already had her insta, so I said that you have my insta, you can text me there. 

She replied, I barely use insta, I'm more into Facebook. Do you have Facebook?

Surprisingly, I more of a Facebook person, so I said that. So she took my phone and typed her name, and asked me to send her a text since her ID doesn't allow requests to be sent, so she has to send me one, which she did eventually. 

After a while, she had to leave, so before leaving, she asked when am I available, so that she'd let me know next time she's in the neighborhood. 

We hugged and she left. 

After a while I sent her a text saying it was nice running into her, and she replied see you next time. I replied absolutely, and left my phone number as well, just in case. 

Unfortunately, I mistakenly shared her some links which I unsent before she even saw them, then wrote and apology saying it was meant for my cousin. 

She saw those texts, few hours later, but didn't reply anything yet.

Looking for a review. Also, what should I expect from this situation now?

Sometimes I feel like I need retribution from opposing parties, but honestly it doesn’t feel right acting on things that have long since passed. Growing up I associated having any sense of pride with entitlement and had very low self worth. It caused becoming very agreeable and out of touch with myself. I’ve begun trying to unlearn these unhealthy behaviors, but in turn I’ve discovered the traumatic pain that was being stepped on by all the people I couldn’t say “no”, “fuck off” or outright defend myself from. I don’t know what to do with my anger. I’m angry at myself for being so weak. It makes me feel worthless as a man. No matter how strong I make myself, no matter how much I learn, no matter who I attach myself to, I still feel like that helpless little boy who had no one. Idk what I’m asking right now.

She appeared to be like she was anywhere between late 30s to early 50s. She looked somewhere between a cougar or a ""real housewife"". As I was walking, I slightly checked her out (didn't ogle her). It was low key. Like a ""hello, how are you today"" type gesture. As I turned my back to look at her, she was looking at me, too. Does that mean that she thought I was cute? Was she flattered? Was she offended? It's probably nothing but I am curious what she could be thinking about me. I hope she doesn't think I'm a creep.

However, he was always mentioning other women. Whether that was simply checking them out, having crushes on them, dating them etc. There were moments when he would be flirtatious, compliment me or make suggestive comments but it never went beyond that.

Currently he’s single but not over his ex whom he had been in a serious relationship for years. Constantly mentioning how hot she is, how he misses her and always talking about her vag. Right now I’m doing my best to be a good friend by being understanding, supportive and giving my advice and opinions on things as I’ve done for years.

But I think I’ve played the friend role too long to be seen as real option. And constantly hearing about other women, I can’t help but compare constantly and afterwards I feel pretty low.

Right now I’m torn between moving on or actually pursuing him and telling him how I feel. Should I tell him? If so, should I wait until he’s moved on to tell him?

I’m at a place in life where what I want to do (own a home) requires a level stability. This means working a full time job, saving money, saving money, and minimizing driving. Additionally, my vehicle unexpected broke down and now I’m gonna have to blow my savings and finance something. Feels like a giant step backwards.

I don’t need to spend money to have fun but I do feel like I’m limited to (2) days a week where I can enjoy myself, and that’s if I’m not using the time on errands, maintenance, or chores.

I guess I’m just struggling to find time to enjoy myself and I feel like it’s only gonna get worse. The little free time I do have I end up feeling tired and want to spend the hour watching TV.

Not sure what to think of the situation and I've talked about it on r/ADHD_partners and r/dismissiveavoidants a bit but I think it would help to ask men in general. My two guy friends are telling me they have used this excuse, and another told me he has pulled away from a girlfriend for 2 months out of stress, so I'm not sure what to think.

I (36F) dated a guy (35M) for 1.5 months. First date he told me he had ADHD and very clearly laid out all that it entailed - he has trouble focusing, he fidgets a lot, he forgets to eat often, he doesn't like to eat in front of people, often forgets to text, 'tricks' himself into chores, gets distracted by noise, etc. We clicked super hard though, and he said he was working on these issues, so I didn't judge. He texted me daily with good mornings, good nights, hey beautifuls, etc. He saw me 1 to 2 times a week. I panicked the first time we had sex (bad relationships in the past) and he just held me and listened to my reasons, and was very understanding. We got past it. He promised me to never ghost. Then, he moved closer to me 2 weeks ago.

We had one date since he moved and he like... shut down. He would text me about how he had no time and was constantly busy with his job, his daughter. How he felt like a 'jello man' trying to keep up with everything. He promised he would tell me if he could see me last Friday but didn't get back to me, so at 5 PM I asked him what was up and if he still wanted to pursue this. He didn't say one way or the other, just that he was stressed and pulling away from everyone. So I told him I'd give him space for now but to lmk if he wanted to hang out or talk. It's been radio silence since.

Men of Reddit... he told me how ADHD makes him shut down, but idk if this is an outright rejection. Have you wanted to get rid of a girl you're dating and just say you're too busy/stressed? Or something similar? I want to reach out if this is full on deactivation, but I don't want to if this is an excuse.

I'm 29 years old. I am far from being the man I want to be and being the man my father could never be. I was never taught how to do things. I wasn't taught about work. I wasn't taught about how to talk to women. I wasn't taught how to take care of myself. 
In the past 5 years I have taught myself, self care, communication with others, and communication with myself. The part I can't seem to get through is working. Everyday I wake up to go to work, I dread. The idea of giving someone else my time so I can make a fraction of the money hurts my heart, the feeling is so strong I have been known to just not show up or quite on a random morning, but I don't want to live like this. I want to learn how to like the idea of making money and going to work. I want to learn how to keep work at work and keep home at home. I don't expect help or advice but if you can give it awesome.

903,xres1y,How do you get over resentment toward your partner?,"Self-explanatory title. I'm developing resentment toward my partner and I want to know how to stop it, because I love her. 

For some background, I deal with mental illness which causes me to fixate/obsess over negatives (experiences, feelings, hypotheticals, etc). It takes a lot of effort to get myself clear of that headspace, but it takes a lot less to take that progress away. My girlfriend knows about this, and I keep her informed on how I'm doing without giving her a role as my therapist. 

This past weekend, she made a comment that took a lot of wind out of my wings. We talked about it in the moment and she apologized, but she left the next day for a month-long trip to what sounds like paradise. Now, I'm stuck here with the thought of what she said reverberating in my head, picking up the pieces on my own while she gets to galivant carefree. And I'm torn between just working through it alone because it's a feature of my condition that I can't blame her for, or telling her that her comment undid a lot of progress that I had to make on my own and that it makes me mad to see her having so much fun while I'm cleaning up the mess which, in my mind, she made. 

I don't even know what I'd expect from her if I told her how I'm feeling. I don't blame her for the fact that I have a mental illness, and I know that if she weren't in my life, I would have to deal with other triggers on my own. It seems like we'd both just feel worse about it than we do.

922,xrbg9j,Boyfriends behaviour has changed and I’m unsure what to do/ what it means,"
I (18F) have been dating my boyfriend R (18M) for 2 and a half years. This past week we’ve both started University ( known as college in america ) in different cities, i wouldn’t really call it long distance because we are a 20 minute train away. Since then he’s been very weird with me, taking ages to reply to me but being on snapchat and watching my stories, not calling me at night like he used to even if he’s at home,  giving me short replies, or just leaving me on read. I’ve asked him multiple times if something is up and if he still wants to be with me, and he’s saying yes, we’ve spoke about this nearly everyday this week as I don’t really do well with the whole ‘viewing my story and not replying’ because it feels like silent treatment and i have a lot of childhood trauma from that. He apologises yet continues to do it. I’ve communicated how I feel but it doesn’t result in a change of behaviour. What does his behaviour mean? I thought I’d rather ask men because as men you know why men act the way they do",1664467023,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/xrbg9j/boyfriends_behaviour_has_changed_and_im_unsure/,askmen

929,xrahgm,How to make my partner feel respected?,"Hi Men of Reddit!

A troubling refrain has been coming up in my relationship a lot lately: My partner (31M) doesn't feel I (35F) respect him.

The problem is, I do! I think he's brilliant, capable, handsome, talented, hard-working, and compassionate. Yes, we have our issues and there are some moments where my respect wanes (bouts of unfounded jealousy, for example). But aside from this, my general baseline is a feeling of respect and admiration. 

I am becoming more aware of the things I do which are *disrespectful*, like being passive aggressive rather than direct, not asking for help, considering the feelings of friends and family before his, and second guessing him on things like directions. Clearly, I've got a lot of issues that make me tough to be in a relationship with. I'm working on them through therapy and group work. 

But what I am wondering is, in addition to reducing the things that make him feel disrespected, what **positive** actions can I take to show that I respect him in our day to day? I've asked directly, but I get the sense he wants me to ""just know."" 

So, men of Reddit, what does your partner do that makes you feel respected? How do you know your partner respects you?

939,xr8jqa,Why Do I Suddenly Stink,"If this isn’t the correct place for this, or there is a better sub, let me know.

For about the last 2 months, maybe 3, I have noticed that I absolutely stink.  I’m never really sweaty, but I stink anyway. It’s not normal BO.  My feet stink when I take off my shoes. My ass stinks. Under my arms stinks. No one has complained, but I started to notice so I started asking people (mom, sister, some co-workers I’m close with) and they all say they’ve noticed as well, starting around the same time I did but didn’t want to say anything. They confirmed it was not a problem before or at least not that they noticed. They say it smells like strong BO, but I disagree. I’ve obviously smelled normal BO smells before and this isn’t the same thing.  There’s a sweetness to it. Have you ever walked past a loaded dumpster on a hot summer day? That’s the best way I can explain it, literal garbage.

I am 28 years old. 6’ 0” at ~175 pounds. Relatively healthy diet, but more importantly it’s unchanged.  I don’t drink. I don’t smoke. I occasionally pop a gummy but that’s maybe once a month or less. I have a very sedentary job and try to walk during lunchtime for 10 minutes, but again that’s been going on for at least the last 3 years. Outside of work I’m active, but again, no recent changes here.  I golf occasionally during the summer, ride my dirt bike on trails by my house, etc. I played basketball in high school and an intramural league in college. This was not a problem when I played sports in high school (confirmed by my family, at least).  I used to meet friends twice a week for a game but we stopped during COVID and haven’t started back up again. I work out every morning at home. Stopped going to the gym during COVID and never went back since it saves me $60 a month.

I drink lots of water all day and always have. Usually at least two gallons.

I have not moved. I’m not dating anyone new. I shop at the same stores I always did buying the same stuff.  Curbside due to COVID.  I wear the same deodorant I’ve been using for 15+ years, same hair gel, same shampoo and body wash.

And I have not had COVID.  I locked down hard due to asthma I’ve had all my life. I know that’s going to be everyone’s go-to, but I feel like if I got it it would have been bad for me. We quarantined for work almost the entirety of 2020 and 2021. I haven’t taken any trips, haven’t associated with anyone outside of my core group until about a year ago. For most of quarantining I worked out at home. Tested weekly. Never felt sick, never lost my sense of smell or had any other issues. And any time someone I knew had it I was never around them before or after and their symptoms were very obvious.

I called my doctor, who basically blew me off and said that something had to have changed and it’s either COVID or diet related but I ruled those out. I even went through a period in August of about 2 weeks where all I ate were chicken breast, veggies and water just to see if there was a change and it didn’t help.  I was very unhappy with my doctor over his handling of the situation and I’m looking for a new one but that’s gonna take time as everyone is busy and appointments are 3 months out.

953,xr73du,How to find more like-minded people in life?,"Hi everyone, I will try to keep this as short as possible!

Basically, my school demanded on testing me when I was 15, they concluded I had ADD with a ‘genius’ IQ level. I don’t consider myself that ‘smart’ and don’t hold much weight to it because there is so much I don’t know yet and there are people waaaayyy more intelligent than me.

However, a lot of my thoughts, goals, and hobbies often are completely different from my friends, family, and girlfriend. Which can make it hard for us to understand/relate to one another on a deeper level.

I started university last year, I was a terrible student, never showed up to a class, never did my homework and always just read a summary twice before a test, yet I passed the year with a good average. So I started a double business major this year to challenge myself more and find more like-minded people, but I honestly haven’t found much success. I have goals that a lot may deem as unrealistic, like actually changing the world, becoming the best in the world in something, and being able to retire my mother before 30.

I don't look down on any of my friends or their goals and don't feel superior towards anyone, I just know what is in my realm of possibility and I can only achieve true intrinsic happiness once I accomplish those goals.

I just hope I won’t have to walk this life path entirely by myself, and I am looking for your advice on finding like-minded people.

955,xr5yad,How to avoid spending money on strippers/say no when you are going to be forced to be around them?,"Long story short I'm going to a bachelor party where the other guys have decided on strippers.

I dont get anything out of them so I just don't want to participate. Needless to say this means I've only ever been to ripper bars and never had hired entertainment come to an Airbnb. 

I work hard for my money and don't want to spend more than I have on rippers because I'd rather just buy more booze and/or cocaine. I'll buy a lap dance for the groom if he really wants one but I'm good without. I'm OK with partying with them around. But I'm not tossing cash in their direction.

Given my lack of experience I guess I'm just asking if a simple ""no thanks I'm good"" will do? Should I take it a step further and say I'm gay so they don't take it personally? Normally I wouldn't have an issue being straight up rude as I have no issues looking like an asshole if people get pushy. But I don't want to ruin everyone else's time.

I just want to know how to reject them without causing a scene or whatever. Thanks in advance for the advice.",1664452735,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/xr5yad/how_to_avoid_spending_money_on_stripperssay_no/,askmen

984,xr0a61,How do I make a man with a broken heart feel safe?,"Hello all. I’m a female college student and made a new friend who I came to discover I had feelings for. He’s very outgoing, funny and sweet to me. Often plays me guitar and sings for me, helps me, cheers me on and talks to me after hours even about random little things. I asked him about relationships and he told me he was cheated on twice, and his other relationship had an ugly end. He told me he was afraid of being in a relationship in general because he doesn’t want to get hurt. He doesn’t know I have feelings for him and although it may seem obvious to some, I still am not 100% sure he likes me (which is a whole other post in itself). When it comes to feelings he’s very reserved, which is understandable. So my question for you, men, is how can I make him feel cared for and protected and loved? Although we are not partners or dating he’s still my friend. I want him to feel safe. How do I make an emotionally damaged man feel safe and loved without overwhelming him?

I have my own business and make a little extra so I’ve always been there to help her when she was short on bills. She kept telling me she was going to help me get a new car, as mine has 250,000 miles and is rusted out and it hurts my business rolling up in it. She eventually said she was only giving me $3000 or so for a “down payment on a new car” which she said was about the amount that I’ve helped her over the past couple of years. I can’t explain how gutted I felt. I gave her that money out of love and kindness, not to get it back. She has plans to get a new car, go on shopping spree etc… granted she is going to pay for a honeymoon, I’m sure I’ll get to live in a nice house rent free and I’ll overall greatly benefit from this but I didn’t sign up for the marriage for money. She is supposed to be my partner and best friend and I keep thinking about how if the roles were reversed I would never do/get anything she couldn’t have.

1001,xqx83w,What to do for the man that has everything on an anniversary?,"**Context:**

My 2 year anniversary is coming up in October. Me and him work two completely different industries, I work in film, he works in business management for different cyber services. So we both go a lot of different places for work and always bring each other things when we find a cool shop. So It's pretty hard to think of something I haven't already bought him. I do have a date planned already for the day, but I don't consider that a *gift*, I definitely want to actually get him something physical. He's mentioned liking the concept of promise rings before, but I personally have never seen promise rings as a milestone. I am considering it just because I at least know he likes them, but so far I don't want to make that the number one idea.

***More details:***

He likes things that are home related. He's a big music fan. He's a big art fan. He likes clothes/fashion, but he also would need to pick it out himself because he's picky with clothes. We have a pretty big collection of pipes, he loves the custom ones on Etsy, but that would feel like its for both of us. He WANTS a new computer for the office but I think that might be over budget for this especially since It's so close to Christmas. He really likes pride related stuff, but I think I'll explode if I see one more pride flag appear in our place. He is pretty fascinated by the different things in *adult* *stores*, but again I feel like that would be for both of us.

*Open to any ideas but preferably something realistic.*",1664422630,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/xqx83w/what_to_do_for_the_man_that_has_everything_on_an/,askmen

1003,xqx1o7,How to deal with an unwanted pregnancy?,"My boyfriend of 6 years and I have two children (one that is just mine, and one that we had together). Shortly after having our child together, my boyfriend decided that he was done having children. I always wanted more, and if I being honest I pestered him for more kids. 

Within the last year, I came to terms with not having anymore children. He went back to school to further his degree in his current field, and I left a well paying job to change careers completely.

I have been having some strange health symptoms for the past couple of weeks, and decided to take a pregnancy test on Monday. The test was mainly to calm my anxious mind, and not actually because I thought I was pregnant. I have had an IUD for the past 4 years and have had yearly checkups on it with no issue. To my surprise, the pregnancy test I took was positive. I made a frantic call to my OB, and he got me in right away and said that everything looked normal and healthy (other than my IUD being missing). 

I am shocked, scared, and worried, but would be lying if I said I wasn’t excited deep down. My partner on the other hand is not excited. We have barely talked since the positive test, and he won’t tell me what he is feeling. I know based off of his mood and the few things that he has said that he is really struggling with the news. I am trying to give him his space, but hope he opens up soon. After all, we have many similar feelings and I would like someone to discuss them with.

1004,xqwxxf,"How can I (28F) be an understanding and fair partner while also letting my husband (34M) know that I feel like a lot of the reasons he gets mad at me aren't because of what I did, but because of his own reactions to what I did?"," I've (28F) seen on reddit quite a few times that men feel in relationships that women want them to open up and show their feelings but when they do, their female partner gets mad at them and they end up feeling dejected.

I feel like that may be happening in my relationship and I'd like to know how I can be better for my husband (34M). We have been together for 1.5 years. It isn't easy.

After freezing me out as he normally does, and after asking him if something is wrong (which I always have to do, he doesn't just tell me right away) today my husband told me he was angry with me because I yelled at him in the grocery store and told him to ""stop yapping over me."" I don't feel like I yelled at all, to me that seems so absurd that I'd yell at my husband in a grocery store as I don't think of either of us as particularly obnoxious or loud. He said I embarrassed him. I said I didn't yell and I wondered if that choice of words was hyperbole to make him feel better but he said no, ""he's just quieter"" than me. I did tell him to quit yapping but entirely playfully. I really didn't think anyone could take ""quit yapping"" as a serious sentence.

A few weeks ago he froze me out for half a day (I didn't even really notice) because I had almost dropped one of his expensive japanese bowls. When I finally dragged out of him if something was wrong, he said I was ""throwing his shit around."" Again, all I did was pick it up and put it down. So to have someone angry with you about something so foolish (the possibility of something almost breaking? I feel like as an adult we know accidents happen, but I didn't even almost drop it, he thought I almost dropped it) I was sooo annoyed at his emotions.

He has expressed to me before that he doesn't feel safe opening up to me because I am often upset by his feelings. And I admit that's totally true. Not ""angry"" necessarily, but I do feel a lot of his anger at me is his own doing. He is sensitive. But to what degree should I be taking responsibility for that? I love him and I want to do and say the right things, but authentically. I don't want to beg for forgiveness for emotional reactions I feel he brought on himself.

It also seems to really annoy him when I say that there are two truths and its best we both recognize each others experience and assume the other didn't have malicious intentions. It's sort of met with an ""all my life people have made me question my emotions and experiences. There is a truth of what happened,"" type of thing.

Then again, I see all these posts about men saying they don't feel safe opening up, because wifey invalidates their feelings.

Any advice?

TLDR;

I've (28F) seen a lot of posts on reddit from men saying they open up to their female partners emotionally, only for their partner to invalidate their feelings. I don't want to do that to my husband (34M), but I feel so much of the things he gets mad at me for are a result of his own doing and emotional sensitivities. How can I be a good partner, while also expressing that I think he's got himself worked up and a lot of this could be solved by him doing internal work rather than just being ""mad"" at me?",1664421774,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/xqwxxf/how_can_i_28f_be_an_understanding_and_fair/,askmen

Ngl, I have always considered myself conventionally unattractive to women so this is extremely puzzling. I know, I know ""beauty is in the eye of the beholder"", but still I could not figure out the reason why she'd go out of her wat to text me when she probably didn't even have my number.

The only possible scenarios I came up with are:

1. She thinks I am rather capable in the subject and striking a friendship might be worthwhile.

2. She has no friends and thought I was approachable, yet did not want to make it in person.

3. She thinks I am interesting and is looking for sonething more personal (obviously just testing me probably to see if I am indeed interesting). HIGHLY UNLIKELY LOL.",1664421056,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/xqwp42/whyd_a_female_classmate_i_have_never_spoken_to/,askmen

1011,xqvhui,What are some subtle signs a man wants to touch a woman?,"So if you are sitting next to the woman you have feelings for and you come into just under centimeters of her are you wanting to touch her or feel her?

A man I sat next to who I know as a friend/acquaintance at school had to sit next to me in a meeting with a third person. He sat next to me as I was a part of his team and that was required. The other person was across from us.

During this, he leaned back in his chair and crossed his legs towards me, this made me cross my leg away to give him more room as I felt that he might be uncomfortable with how close I was to him. He remained crossed towards me. I sat up straight and then he did the same. 

I crossed my leg towards his after a while of him sitting like that, to show I was comfortable with the close proximity and to see if he would move away...

 While he was listening to the other person and talking to them he started to edge/swing his foot towards mine under the table like he wanted to touch my foot with his, and while talking to the other person he started to exaggerate his hand movements, coming inches from my knee with his fingers... he did some more hand movements where his hands hovered over my leg. I don't know I felt this overwhelming sense that he wanted to put his hand on my leg or rest his shoe on my shoe, but didn't do either cause we were partly visible to the other person and he wasn't so sure that I would want either of those things. 

There have been many of these encounters where we come just centimeters from touching, or when we work on a project together we pass things to each other we will hold our hands together or our hands will clash a bit. When we brush against one another or tap each other we both hover for a few seconds and pretend it didn't happen. I'm not sure if this is all just tiny accidents constantly happening or if there is some type of subtle thing to these happenings. 

Men, do you do things like this with the women you want to touch? if so, why?

I have never seen behavior like this and I love to study people. This guy is a mystery. First of all, I am not used to a man being so comfortable being centimeters from touching me most of the time we are in each other's presence. Frankly, I crossed my leg towards him to show that if he wanted to ""accidentally"" touch me, he was welcome to ""accidentally"" do so and it's almost like he got the hint.",1664417639,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/xqvhui/what_are_some_subtle_signs_a_man_wants_to_touch_a/,askmen

I've been lucky enough to date and have a few relationships with girls I really liked, however, every time I meet a conventionally ""hot"" woman (let's say typically the 3 women you find the most attractive at your gym/workplace/class), I always feel some kind of frustration at not ""being in the mix"" (English is not my native laguage, sorry), or not being even considered in the slightest by these women, as if I was just an invisible guy passing by. I am not interested in these women more than less ""conventionnaly hot women"" in a relationship-seeking way, as I value other aspects of a person much more highly than their looks. Which means I don't feel ""limited"" in my choices of a life partner or anything. It's just that life is short and I want to live it to the fullest, and as shallow is it might seem, well, dating these ""conventionally hot women"" are part of a life lived to the fullest in the way I see it.  


Good news is I have so much things to improve in myself still, and I know what these things are and working on it every day (obviously for other reasons than just women), but I just find the tought of maybe never actually being able to date a conventionnaly hot woman somewhat irritating, and I was just wondering what you guys were dealing with it (if you're having to deal with it).

For context, I'm a big botanist. I love plants and flowers, and I would even like to do some floristry training at some point in my life. I really, really love flowers. They're a very easy way to my heart. For some reason, he just....refuses(?) to get me flowers...ever? 

He often says it's because he doesn't think to? Which I can find a bit hard to take, since I always build in the things he says he likes, I just put them into shopping lists or something, but there's this weird resistance. It's got to the point that a male colleague of mine got me flowers to congratulate me for getting a job I wanted, and I nearly cried. 

Does it seem like something else is going on? Is there anything I can do that might make it easier for him to understand why this is important to me?

1070,xqlmkj,Started wearing a condom and she says it has gotten too rough. What are my options?,"TLDR: Started wearing condoms. It is now too rough for my wife. What options do I have I haven’t thought of?

My wife for the longest time was using an implanted contraceptive, but we both agreed recently that the side effects were not worth it. No problem I thought, I’ll buy a variety pack of different condoms (Trojan &amp; Skyn) and we’ll figure out which works best.

Well it turns out that with all the ones I’ve tried so far it’s gotten a lot rougher for her. She thinks since I can’t feel as much I’ve started going too deep and rough for her. It lasts about 2-3 times as long now and all in all it’s gotten overwhelming for her.

Since we’re not worried about STD/STI issues, is there any issue in just not rolling the condom all the way down so I can tell if I’m too deep or not? My family therapist mentioned that other positions can help with the deepness, but anything besides missionary is too overwhelming for her so that won’t work.

Is there anything I’m forgetting to try? I can’t use condoms with ridges or bumps or anything because once again it’s too overwhelming for her.

We don’t want to be reckless and invite another baby into this world right now, but I also don’t want to take any permanent sterilization options right now either.

I've had a very busy 6-7 weeks and didn't even realize I had gone a few weeks without logging into Discord. I was pretty upset to realize that when I logged into Discord that no one hit me up to ask about me or anything. 

I'm not expecting ppl to check up on me and it's also on me to hit up my friends too as it's a two way street, but I found it very upsetting to know that I could disappear for almost 2 months from a group that I talk to more than my own fiance, and they don't ask at all about me... 

Is this what relationships are like when we all get older? We're all in our early 30s, of the group, im the only one that works in an office so they are like clockwork, at 5pm they leave work, get home and log on by 6pm and chat until they go to bed at 9pm. 

even my fiance's friends who i see maybe once or twice a week who are not even my friends, but her friends, will text me or hit me up on our group slack channel to see how things are going and to ask if i want to grab a drink... am i investing my time into the wrong group?",1664377220,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/xqezkr/how_do_you_deal_with_your_friends_not_reaching_out/,askmen

Finally asked her for drinks and we went out last night to a nice wine bar. She put effort into her dress and we shared a bottle of red, talking for a few hours which I thought went well and took as a good sign, although I was afraid to break the touch barrier which in hindsight would've helped. As we said a quick/slightly awkward goodbye I didn't kiss her but she suggested that we grab food and drinks sometime again later this week which I took as a good sign.

Got home and thought it went amazingly and dropped her a message saying I really enjoyed it and that I wanted to kiss her (bit cheesy but I ran it through one of my girl mates who was in the room with me and said I should do it haha). Then got some texts back saying she had a really good time, but she's doesn't know where she stands with that right now and she's still confused about it, we have a really good vibe going and she wants to get to know me better 'amicably' and she hopes it doesn't get in the way of us.

I replied saying sorry for reading it wrong but glad she had a good time.

To me that seems like a soft rejection and the ""its not you, its me"" but just worded differently which is fair enough.

I do really really like her and I can't see myself being just friends with her for at least a while but what makes it harder is that she's in a club at university I'm in and I'll be seeing her there about once a week.",1664352465,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/xq6ndp/grabbed_drinks_with_girl_i_liked_and_she/,askmen

1229,xpwv3d,What’s the perfectly cutting thing to say to the older man who has played me like a fiddle?,"I spend six months of the year in a small town in a foreign country. During the last few days of my stay, I slept with a much older man (I’m a 27 y/o woman, he’s in his late 50’s). We’ve had chemistry for a long time but I never thought he’d actually make a move on me - this town loves drama and gossip and you kind of have to keep a low profile to uphold your reputation. It’s silly but it’s the truth. 

To make a long story short, I began to get the hunch he had a girlfriend because of his strange behavior afterwards. For example, the last night I was in town, he comes over but leaves at 9:30pm, saying he wants to come back first thing in the morning at 6:30am and get in bed with me while I’m waking up. That morning when he comes over, I ask him what the deal is/where his head is at. Perfect opportunity to tell me he has a gf. He says nothing about it. Just generic shit that men think women like to hear.

I leave the country. We talk every few days. He reaches out, he’s very responsive, he’s engaging. He tells me how rare and special our connection was, and that he thinks about me all the time. In our last conversation he literally says “don’t stop contacting me.” Then he ghosts me for five days.

During these last few days while he’s ghosting me, my friend tells me he DOES have a gf, and she happens to be a woman who he has mentioned several times as the “fabric lady.” Turns out they’ve been together for years and she shares a workshop with him. I’ve been inside this workshop many times with this man, admired this woman’s work out loud, and he’s just referred to her as “this lady.” The morning he came over at 6:30am, he told me he was running late because he had to let the “fabric lady” into the workshop.

I’m not one to send second a message after someone has ghosted, but I couldn’t help myself. I wanted to move on from the anxiety and anger I was feeling. I told him I had just learned of something that was making my skin crawl. He responded IMMEDIATELY: “hi how are you, what did you hear?”

Lol. I didn’t reply. I’ll let him sit with it for a few days. What should I say when I do?",1664323118,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/xpwv3d/whats_the_perfectly_cutting_thing_to_say_to_the/,askmen

1374,xp77iq,"When should men step in, when they see other men being toxic?","As a 6’, bearded human, with an adaptive voice, working in a technical field, I have seen my female co-workers treated badly, and with disrespect. 
By management, AND customers. 

Many contexts are easy to deal with. 
For example:
In a meeting where management is imposing  an idiotic process, when the question raised by a female co-worker is ignored or disrespected, I will attempt to artfully pile on… “hey, that question Ruby asked, about how to handle it when the process fails, and what the next step is… is there an answer?”…

This has never been unwelcome, in that context. 
Except, of course, by management, who have no answer to the question. 

It’s the CUSTOMERS where the question lies. 

As a senior tech, it’s fair to say fellow techs came to me with questions. It’s fair to say that customers saw this, so, not EVERY instance of a customer saying “I have doubts about this technician, let me talk to THAT guy”, and pointed at me….

Not EVERY instance of that was because it was a male customer, talking to a female technician. 

I’m good, and plus, there’s the beard. 

But SO MANY TIMES, my esteemed, and capable fellow technicians were questioned on their qualifications and processes, SIMPLY ON THE BASIS they were female, or, that the customer was struggling with their gender. 

It pissed me off, just watching it happen… 
And you could almost always TELL, that the disrespect came from a place of gender bias… and was toxic.. and, frankly, it wasn’t limited to men, by the way….

In some of these instances, I was requested to step in, in some of these instances I felt compelled to step in from my own feelings of “how dare you speak to this person that way”…. “This technician is capable, and qualified, and has diagnosed your issue in a professional manner.”

And in some instances, it was so significantly satisfying to watch the toxic reaction get disintegrated by the person being disrespected….

I have ANECDOTES, people… 

What one wishes never to do, is to take the power away from someone, to handle their oppressor.",1664255236,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/xp77iq/when_should_men_step_in_when_they_see_other_men/,askmen

1389,xp5hpz,Girlfriend (F 24)of 4 years blocked me (M 24) why?!,"Hello I mean there really isn’t much to my story. For about a week I haven’t called my girlfriend i just getting into a new big person IT analysis job with a salary way more than what I expecting fresh out of college so I haven’t had the time. I do however text a-bit the week I hadn’t called her but that isn’t our primary way of communicating when we are apart. She had express wanting some distance the week before when I was with her helping moving her things for college, I did too she was starting to annoy me towards the end of my stay. So naturally I pull away when I returned home mainly because she asked. I spent about two and half weeks with her. 
          We live about 5 hours away from our college so I stayed with her for the beginning of the semester working remotely. I am a gym head so I always go to the gym everyday and take my gym very seriously and she knows that, we’ve been together for 4 years. Long story short she called me two Fridays ago ranting about things going wrong in her life at the moment. I of course heard her out and support her like always. She said that she was upset that I didn’t call her all week and felt less important compared to my commitment to my job and the gym. 
 
      I didn’t pay that comment too much attention because literally the last week she expressed how she needed space so I just assumed she doesn’t feel like that anymore and didn’t bring it up in the conversation. I was in the gym at the time at the end of my workout. The gym is packed and loud so she demanded that I leave right away to continue talking to her. 
      I refused and said I needed 20 mins more to finish up my last reps and I’m all hers. She kept making deadlines like if you don’t leave in 1 minute I will hang up. I continued my sets and said just 20 minutes, I wasn’t leaving just because she said so. She then hanged up and hasn’t returned my calls and texts since then. I just found out today that the reason is that she has blocked my number. It’s been a week and three days and she has not contacted me or unblock me. She hasn’t blocked me on any other social media but I haven’t reached out to her in them either. 

    We’ve been together for four years and she has never blocked me for anything and this little disagreement about me leaving the gym isn’t even serious compared to the other hurdles we have gone through. Quite rather tiny. Why did she block me? Should I break up with her or treat this like a break up? This seems rather childish to me and really out of character.

My reason for doing so so far has been that the classes felt off and that I didn’t think I had enough patience to deal with people.

Looking back on it, I wonder to myself if I have just been making excuses to not challenge myself. I’m still somewhat wonder about what else I can discover by studying the mind, but I also wonder if it would be something worth pursuing practically.

Now 31 and I’m still supporting my old parents because their pensions aren’t enough to cover the rising costs in my home country. My girlfriend of seven years broke up with me because she was tired of waiting. I understood and acknowledged that I’m too insecure and have missed out on so much in life. 

I don’t feel like I’m in my 30s. I still feel like a 21 yo who is hungry for the life he never pursued because he was wrongly imprisoned.  

There’s so many things I want to do: see the world, go to graduate school, take photos of wild animals, try different food, raves, techno clubs, etc.",1664243232,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/xp2vni/what_made_you_realize_married_life_was_not_your/,askmen

1447,xoyfy6,How to split finances with bf ! Help,"Hello everyone,

My almost 1 year boyfriend and I are moving in together in the next couple of months. So we’ve been busy with deciding what furniture we need to buy, how to re-arrange the place, and all these sort of things. 

He will move into my place (owned by my family), so he will not pay any rent, and we decided to split bills equally. 

The furniture we decided we need are the following: new furniture for the walk-in closet to fit his clothes, a bigger tv and a more comfortable sofa.
Now, I’m always ok with splitting bills, but I feel a bit uncomfortable at the moment, as my salary is 1200 euro a month, and for me to buy those things (which will cost around 2500/3000 euro) is a considerable effort, financially speaking. My bf makes almost 3000 euro a month and his current rent is 900 euro a month. I feel a bit resentful that he hasn’t proposed to pay a bit more for the furniture, even just 100/200 euro more than me, since he has more resources. 

Now, what I’m asking you is, what do you think about this situation? 

We have a very good relationship, good boundaries, and clear communication. Yet I’m not able to communicate on this with him as I’m worried I’m expecting something I shouldn’t. 

My thought process is that he’s moving into my place, which will help him to save 900 euro a month, so I would kinda appreciate him to spend a bit more on the furniture (like 60% of it) than I. But perhaps I’m wrong expecting this. 

In the last few days, I dropped him hints about feeling overwhelmed with all these upcoming expenses and he said we can wait, that there isn’t any rush for us to buy the new furniture, but the reality is that I won’t be able to save money for it (given my income), and I will end up asking my family to help me buying the stuff. What I actually would like is him saying he can take care of a bigger part of the bill in relation to the new furniture, but this is not happening.

He’s pretty generous, I believe, but on this matter I don’t know how to behave and whether or not my point makes sense. The thing is, if I was in a position with more money and moving into his place, I would have offered him to pay more for new stuff.

TLDR: asking my partner who is moving into my place to spend more than I on the new furniture we need to buy for the house",1664232138,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/xoyfy6/how_to_split_finances_with_bf_help/,askmen

We’re long out of that infatuation stage of things—and its wonderful, really. I feel like things are better every day. Sometimes I ask him how he views things, but its mostly just because I love watching him struggle to explain what he sees when he looks at me and what he thinks when his life meshes with mine. I find it endearing. 

What I’ve generally got out of him is that I’m a constant goal for him that he’s never tired of, when he looks at me he sees a woman that he gets to spend his life with, and he gets a “warm” feeling of security and safety with me, where he WANTS to perform but knows that I wouldn’t think badly of him if he didn’t. He has an intrinsic trust that I’ll always be there and he can’t stop being grateful for it. 

I feel the same way regarding him, pretty much to the letter. Everything about him is a comfort. His smell. His possessions. His voice. The little quirks he’s got. 

But we’re not the only couple on earth with a long, stable, loving relationship. And now I’m curious about how love and the way men express it differs in long-lasting relationships.

What got me thinking about this more was reading the Bible and seeing how men in it would openly express their strong love for each other, and it seemed to be a normal custom to platonically kiss each other, etc. 

I think this sort of thing is ideal and healthy, and it will make for stronger and overall much more well rounded men.

I’ve been on 3 dates with this guy (I’m f). On our second date he told me that he wants to have sex whilst dating as part of assessing compatibility. I told him I need a bit more connection. We made out but after that day we never spoke. I figured that my way of dating didn’t work for him and wrote it off. 

Then he reached out a week later and we messaged a bit whilst he was away, then nothing. Then the day he gets back he asks me to meet for a drink that evening, I was already on a date that was coming to an end so I agreed. We met, had drinks and made out - a lot. Lots of sex talk but no sex. We messaged a bit the next day and I told him I wanted to slow things down physically and he said “yeah sure” but didn’t think we’d done much, but no contact since.

When I’m thinking of all of this, it is more in the context of Scandinavian culture during the Viking age of exploration. Life’s goal for them was relatively set straight forward. They had their way to attain these attributes. I’m not sure modern day men have this ability any longer.

1597,xo8pam,I (40M) have no idea what is going on with my (32F) “friend” &amp; our “relationship?” 🤷🏼‍♂️,"Brief context here as anyone with ADHD, such as myself, will appreciate. I exchanged numbers with this girl a few weeks back. Immediately that same night we got to texting &amp; she come over to my place. She spent the night, we slept in bed together (no sex), we just held hands &amp; cuddled blah blah. She had a boyfriend at the time, but their relationship was on the fritz. She ended up staying the night, every night, for roughly the next two weeks. We did not have sex until the forth night. For whatever that may be worth. She said that she “appreciated me just being able to hold her in bed those first few nights without actually making a move on her.” Not that it was not hard, but respect goes a long way. By the second week she broke up with her, now ex-boyfriend, because of them simply being at different stages in their life. So here is where it gets confusing for me. She introduces me as her “friend.” That’s fine. If it is FWB then just say so, however , she has introduced me to her two children, her mom, her Bible study group, we now attend the Bible study group together &amp; I accompany her to church as well. She has told her counselor (Yes, she has one. I do as well, just for talking about life &amp; things.) She is a nurse &amp; has been staying caring for this sweet elder lady at nights. We literally have sex daily. I think out of nearly a whole month of our newfound “friendship” we have only skipped sex for four nights plus the original four nights so 8 nights total out of a month almost. We are talking hours long sex here. To the point that I went to my doctor &amp; he put me on Viagra just so I could keep up (no complains here). It is amazing btw! We even started a diet together. Well, not really a die, but a permanent better &amp; healthier way of eating. We do everything together outside of our work. She has even introduced me to the elder lady that she is caring for during the overnight hours. She cooked me breakfast this morning. She is always wanting to hold hands when we are out &amp; even in the car. She is always smacking my ass or pinching my ass out in public. She is really big into PDA. She is literally all over me in public &amp; when we are together at one another’s place of residence &amp; when we are just relaxing watching a movie she always wants to cuddle &amp; hold hands. Like you have too or she gets upset, which I find it sweet personally. She messages me “kissie” face emojis &amp; tells me that she misses me all of the time. On one hand she tells me that we need to be “careful” during sex, but on the other hand she asks me to cum inside of her every time we have sex &amp; to “tell her when I am finishing.” Then she will say “we need to be careful” again &amp; then, just the other night, we were talking on FaceTime &amp; she said that she would “have my baby.” Then proclaimed “did I just say that I would have your baby?” Remember though we are just “friends.” So, with all of that in mind, (&amp; this is just a summary as to all that is going on between the two of us) can someone please tell me wtf is going on? What kind of relationship is this, if any at all? Please be sincere in your replies because this is really important to me. I have strong feelings for her, but I am heavily guarded &amp; I just do not know what is going on here. I really don’t. Just during the time that it has taken me to type this all out she has text me just to see if I made it home safely.",1664165413,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/xo8pam/i_40m_have_no_idea_what_is_going_on_with_my_32f/,askmen

When it came time to pay the bill, our male waiter said to my bf ""let me get the bill for you sir"", which was fine. 

The waiter set the check down in front of him, then my bf proceeded to immediately pass the check to me because it was my turn to pay for our outing since we regularly swap that responsibility between ourselves, given that we have similar salaries. 

The waiter came back, so I handed him MY card from MY side of the table with MY name on it, to which the waiter then turned to my bf and said ""thank you, sir"" while receiving the card from MY hand. He then brought MY card back and handed it to my bf, again saying ""thank you sir, come back and see us again"", all while not really even acknowledging me.

The service up until that point was fine, but my bf and I were both speechless and a bit infuriated after that because it just seemed so odd, as the waiter looked to be about the same age range as us.

I'm a fanfic writer (23 years old) and as you might suspect, not a cisgender man.

The thing is, as a person not socially educated as a man it is kinda obvious when some men write or draw something overly stupid and doesn't know anything about the female experience or body.

So I was wondering if it happens the other way around too, u know?

If you've never read fanfiction I encourage you to, for curiosity, you know? A lot of Male!character x Female!reader and weird gay shipps might content some erroneous beliefs about how the mind and body of a man actually works, I personally recommend AO3

If you've read it, what is the phrase/paragraph/thing that made you think ""oh, no, that's not how this works""? 

It would be really helpful for me to know! So I can write more accurate and realistic characters (Ngl, PWP too)

1646,xo0wek,Need advice on how I (30m) can help my Dad (66m) find some new meaning to life as he nears retirement.,"As the title says, my Dad has lost his way as he's nearing retirement. While there's a variety of factors that contributed to this latest spiral downward, he's confided in me that the heaviest burden holding him down is the feelings that he is no longer needed.

Out of respect for my Dad I won't go into the details but high level: he's been winding down his career so his work is much slower (doesn't feel needed), and he isn't as close to retirement as he planned to be, so I imagine there's some feelings of failure mixed in as well.

Due to his health he isn't up to, nor should he, be trying to relive his glory days of being a big shot. So the simple answer of returning to work isn't as easy for a guy who has run his own company for 30+ years.

I know ultimately he will have to find his own way through this, but I have to try and help him. What are some suggestions?

1667,xnyixi,What's a good way to compliment a guy in passing?,"I (24F) was at BestBuy today, and I was helped by a guy that seemed to really take care of himself. Although he was wearing the uniform he had really subtle jewelry and a nice haircut to compliment it; he seemed quite stylish. 

I wanted to compliment him, and the only thing that came to mind was to tell him he looked handsome. I wasn't sure if that would be considered inappropriate and didn't want to make him feel uncomfortable while he was just trying to do his job, so I didn't. I think I could have still given him a compliment that was more neutral, but I couldn't think of anything. 

I'm not one to give compliments in general to men or women even when I do notice something positive about them (mostly cause of anxiety), but I've been trying to make an effort to change that. 

It feels easier to compliment women because I am one myself, and I'm sure I'm overthinking it, but it feels like I never have the right words to express a compliment to a guy on his general appearance. Actions and such are much easier, imo.

1674,xnxj0e,Is he politely rejecting me or what?,"So this guy began to follow me on IG at the beginning of the year. From time to time we talked about stuff as he replied my stories. I was on a trip before and then I went back to the city where I and this guy too. 

In July we were supposed to meet up in two festivals as he was doing visuals in both of them but for different reasons (me being super busy finishing my thesis and he had covid) we didn’t end up meeting. Summer passed and he went tripping and me too and he would only from time to time replied to my Instagram stories but randomly. I always thought that he was being a bit flirty but not over the top, and as IG is not a dating app I was confused of his intentions.

A month ago I was in a town where he is from and he asked me if a was there. I was the answer the next day and said yes. He told me that he was there the previous day as he was passing by to go somewhere else. I understood that he had the intention of meeting up so I said that when he is back where we live we should do something if he wanted and he agreed.

A month passed by and I didn’t hear from him until one day he liked my IG stories which had pictures of me and the next two days he replied to other stuff and liked another photos of me. So I proceeded to send him a message to see wtf was all this about and asked if he was in town. 

He replied immediately and said he was and basically began to tell me he got promoted and is earning double amount of money and he is super into financial stuff now. That he is going thought a period like confinement and he lost ways on how to interact with people. We then spoke about a festival that is in mid November that we both are going too. I told him that if he wanted to do something before that he should lmk. And then he said yes but he is out the cocoon and mentioned to go to a nice event in a month. 

Im very confused on what this guy wants because he was answering to me super fast and sending me things I know I would like from music to movies and then this I want to see you but in a month I feel is quiet the bullshit.

After a week of talking, we had unexpectedly met for the first time. He was with his friends, who were also my friends. At that moment there were some sparks. We started taking more and more and eventually we went on our first date. The date was great and we had our first kiss. We grew closer and closer but we still weren't official even though we were talking for 6 months. After a while our conversations felt forced and he put an end to it and removed me on everything. I was a little heartbroken, but I got over it. After a few months we rejoined on social media and moved on as good friends. He told me he was going to change schools, my school... I thought it would be nice for us to improve our friendship or even try again romantically. But during the summer I got into an argument with one of his close friends and my friendship with him quickly turned around.

We are now in school together and not talking. But somehow he try's to seek my attention. He continues to make eye contact with me and sometimes is smiles at me if I'm not watching. And not just now and then, but really all the time. I know he misses me and I miss him but I don't want to take the first step because my ego is too big.

I dont even know this dude for a month and at first i thought i was just imagining stuff (like when imitating someone else he got too close like that person and similar stuff) 
But then we went together to a festival (i invited him and a 3rd person, the 3rd person couldnt come and told us last second, i was really looking forward to it so i told him we should still go)
At the festival he put his arm around me a lot and even held my hand, he seemed to look out a lot that i am fine and hugged me multiple times and seemed nervous 

All cute and all and tbh i would give him a chance IF 
A: he wouldnt be my COWORKER 😭
B: he wouldnt have tried to ""impress"" me by trying to seem tough and manly, like making a big deal out of a dude bumping into his shoulder in a CROWDED place 

((C: there were some hints that he could have a pretty bad mindset too but those came more from his friends so not 100% sure but i am Bi so i REALLY dont need someone homophobic or sexist))) 

So yeah, but here comes my mistakes in 😭
I didnt pull my hand away, i left his hand around me and never corrected him (someone even assumed i was his gf and none of us corrected them) 

I did have great fun w him but i was hoping for just being friends w a few ppl at work since i am new yk?? And i am horrible at hinting that i wanna stay platonic etc 😭 i am overly friendly (to everyone) and all? I dont wanna be cold to him (idk if i even can) but at the same time i wanna explain that i cant see him as more than a friend/coworker (also i am HORRIBLE at keeping relationships so that would end bad for SURE )

1704,xntvkj,What’s the kindest way to back out of a date with a man?,"So I (25F) went to a new work friend’s birthday party last night. I’ve only known her for about four months and we’ve hung out just twice, but she sent an invite to the whole (smallish) workplace. I was the only one who was able to attend. Most everyone else who attended were good friends with one another already, but I had a great time and got along well with everyone. 

The party was pretty small, about 12 people. Two of them, both men, asked me out at the end of the night. One of them asked for my number directly, which I was happy to give. The other discerned which number was mine from a group chat the party host made of everyone to send the address and reached out to me that way. 

I’m sort of interested in the first guy, but not the second. With the first guy, there was kind of a vibe going during the night. The second guy, I felt only platonic vibes with. I was caught off guard when he texted me right after the party, and he asked me out almost immediately for something that sounds like a Netflix and chill type situation. I said sure, feeling pressured. 

I’m feeling stuck now. I don’t actually want to go and I’m worried there will also be some pressure to get physical, even if it’s just an arm around the shoulder or something, but the thought of it makes me uncomfortable. I want to back out, but he’s friends with Guy #1 that I actually do want to go on a date with, and he’s also friends with my work friend who hosted the party. Guy #2 is kind of a life of the party type that seemed like a central figure in the friend group, so I feel like if I back out without giving a good reason it might get around to my work friend or the other people who attended the party and make me look bad. I just moved to this city a few months ago to start this job so my social life isn’t exactly crowded at the moment. 

Guy #2 also knows Guy #1 got my number also, as he mentioned it in his texts. Idk if that makes a difference but I also thought that was weird to bring up. I don’t know if Guy #1 knows Guy #2 asked me out or not. 

What’s the best way for me to back out of this date with Guy #2? I will probably see him around in the future as I got along really well with everyone there and will probably hang out with that friend group again. So I don’t want it to be awkward, even if I do date Guy #1…

I’m a 53 yo woman who was in a committed relationship for a long time. I have a professional job that I love, am financially stable, have solid group of friends, and a loving family. People tell me I’m well spoken, and kind. I’m a happy person, have a positive outlook in life and get along w/ people. 

Now, here is where I need your input. I was going to give OLD a chance, and was thinking +/- 10 years might be a good age range. But do you all think in a practical world men in their 40s would set their age range for older women? I predict that many of you are going to say it depends on the man’s preference. I get that, but I think my concern is that many men might not give a woman my age a chance purely bc of age and stereotypes, but if they actually had a chance to see the person first, they might start thinking differently. I know this sounds like a shallow conversation and I hope this doesn’t come out as bragging, but I’m 5’8” 120 lbs and have taken great care of my body and health for years. I eat super healthy, exercise regularly and present myself with confidence and grace. Please know that I’m not trying to be self congratulatory here, and please allow me to say that in today’s world, many of us women in the 50s or older, still look and feel very good, plus we might actually being able to offer men substance and depth in our overall life views. 

I understand that you guys can’t solve a complex matter like age on a Reddit post, but I’m hoping at least we can have a thoughtful conversation about women and their age in the dating world, hoping that we could all learn from one another.

1720,xnqxuj,Confused where to live in my mid 20s,"Hi all, 24 Single M

&amp;#x200B;

I currently live in NYC and really like it here, originally from CA. Love the social scene/nightlife/dating opps in NYC, but miss the space/weather/surfing/driving in california.

I am a solo entrepreneur so I have been slightly lonely in NYC, as I dont have a work community to surround myself with. I have friends here but those that live in NYC know that seeing people can be difficult due to schedules. Id love to get involved in more community activities but I dont know where to start.

I have a relatively high income and can afford to live anywhere, and my work just requires me to be in a safe neighborhood in the US. 

Where would you move if you were me? I have lived in nyc for 1 year. My dream is to be bicoastal between CA/NYC.

I am moreso just confused on what california city to set roots down in. I lived in Newport Beach with a friend during the pandemic (im not from there), and it was awesome, but it still is suburbia. I went to school in LA and would not go back due to the traffic and crime.

I’m wondering if he likes me as more than a friend and his lack of communication is coming from his own personal insecurities and whether he is waiting for me to approach the situation and get a little closer or he is just emotionally unavailable and doesn’t really like me like that,honestly I just want to assume it’s the second option and move on but this person has shown that he cares for me and I don’t wanna hurt him by being cold and distant",1664114780,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/xnoaay/what_do_you_think_it_means_if_a_guy_is_friendly/,askmen

1802,xncafr,How do I kiss him first?,"I (F19) have always been kissed first, usually after the first or second date. Well I recently started seeing this guy (M21) who is super sweet, very funny and overall a really great guy! We met on a dating app, he calls me things like beautiful and cute, he pays for meals (which is super new to me, I paid for our second date cause I felt so bad haha) and we talk every day so I don’t feel like he’s uninterested in me - but he hasn’t kissed me yet and we’ve been on two dates. 


I’m sure for some it’s normal to not kiss after the first few dates but that’s never happened to me before. I think I’d like to kiss him on our next date (which we already have planned) but I honestly don’t know what to do. I’ve kissed a guy first once but I felt like he had been staring at my lips forever and I just went for it. This new guy seems shy and seems to really want to respect boundaries, which is not a bad thing other than the fact that I’ve wanted to kiss him from the first day we’ve met lol. How do I show that I want to be kissed? Or how do I ask him? I’m a bit shy about it all and I want to get it right. I also want to be respectful of his boundaries.

As ive grown as a person, i have learned to not let my ego get in the way of friendship and started reaching out more often.

I have some amazing friends that I love and who love me and support me and encourage my goals and celebrate my success. But I have other friends who have started pocket watching and letting their insecurities and jealousy get the best of them. 

A couple have recently made various comments and digs at me or my other successful friends that were totally uncalled for and have left me reevaluating whether I want to keep them in my life. When I got my first legal job some even asked my salary and didn’t react well when I wouldn’t share it. Others who I felt comfortable sharing that information with down the line didn’t react well when I told them either. One recently complained that me and some of my other friends were a “bunch of yuppies” after I got a new SUV and he literally asked me what I paid for it and I didn’t share.

My best friend told me last night that I should “guard” myself with some of them because he can tell they’re not supportive and they are jealous of the life I’ve built. I hate that some of my lifelong friends who I’ve supported and been there for for years are envious of my success rather than supportive but I don’t want to let that or them hold me back. They’re also not living life the same way as me and don’t have the same priorities anymore.

1878,xn1qon,How do you find inner happiness and confidence? Need advice! :) Thanks! :),"Hi everyone :)! 

To get to the point, I want to learn how to find more inner happiness, peace and confidence. I am also starting counselling, but I just need/want to hear other men's points of view, advice, life lessons or anything... 

If you have any advice, I would appreciate it :) 

About me, if it helps (Maybe this might give a little bit of an inside view of my life) : 

(24 M) After a lot of inner searching, I discovered that much of my happiness comes from a female presence in my life. Until 3 years ago, I was always with someone or had something with someone. I realize this is not healthy, or maybe it is. I don't know. So for a couple of years, I decided to just focus on myself, build myself and try to love myself. 

I changed my life routine to better myself, which I feel is a great step. I wake up at 5:30, go to the gym, go to school for classes, study a lot, hang out with friends and family and try to give myself time as well.  I'm a great student and have a great rapport with all my instructors, and I am always on the dean's list. I've also taken a lot of responsibility in my life; I pay for my family's apartment because my father lost his job, don't rely on my parents for any financial support and offer to help whenever I can. I'm also always there for my friends when they need/want me. I try to push myself and grow whenever I can. I found growth, accomplishments and discipline created happiness and confidence in my life as I slowly become a man. But lately, it doesn't feel the same, I feel lonely, not confident, lost and numb. 

Happy to hear any advice. Be kind or not, maybe there's something I need to hear specifically. I don't know.",1664047696,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/xn1qon/how_do_you_find_inner_happiness_and_confidence/,askmen

My partner(26F) and I (30M) have been together for coming up on 4 years. She's truly wonderful. 

She challenges me in all the ways I need to be, she cares for me, and she's my best friend. 
She's also working on her PhD at the moment. She's a pretty awesome person....

Here's the thing. We never get any time together. When we first started dating she was in her master's and now she's in her PhD. I completely understand that the world of academia is ruthless. It consumes her life. 

Because she is an awesome person, she also has great friends. But I feel that over the last four years, I'm rarely ever her focus of attention. Birthday, sure I'm the centre of attention....and I don't want to be the centre of her attention all the time...I just can't seem to figure out what bothers me so much about not doing stuff together.

It feels like she almost does it intentionally? 

We have always had a very open stream of communication but when it comes to this, it seems to be her blind side. She obviously favours spending time with her friends over me. I donno is this normal? 

Im looking for wisdom, guidance, advice, or maybe even a personal anecdote....I just don't feel like I'm enough I guess.

1882,xn1g52,"If you were one of these men, or if you found out a girl was doing this with 5 men in less than two weeks, what would you feel?"," 

Reasons I'm asking this.

I have a friend who is blowing my tiny mind right now. Quite frankly I've felt very judgemental over what she's been doing, but also extremely worried about her safety.

She split up with a long term boyfriend, and has ever since, been on what she calls a ""slutty streak""

I figured, once these guys go round once, that will be it and they won't return, possibly leaving nasty diseases behind. Luckily, she's using protection.

Apprently though, she's managed to get several what she sees as long term FWBs out of these one night stands. Each of them will be allocated a separate night going forwards. Her words. Separate night of the week. She tells each one about the others she's sleeping with. Intimate details if they ask - some have. Often the night after one she's with another. Very little time in between.

I am going to be honest since this is my throwaway. I feel INCREDIBLY uneasy about all of it. It reeks of a massive clusterfuck drama about to occur. I don't know if she's thinking straight. FIVE. FIVE in a couple weeks - I think even less than a couple weeks.

She's adament they're all respectful, eager to meet her again - one already has been over again so the proof is in the pudding. This is different to what I know of men, with casual sex, it's a one time type deal to my knowledge. I've never had much of it but I have brothers and male friends and this is what they tell me.

She has a strong ""emotional connection"" with one of them, yet slept with someone the night after, and he still came back.

One of these men invited her to his place in the middle of the night and they'd never even met before... she almost went but I convinced her out of it.

I guess what I'm asking is... if you put yourself in their shoes...

Are these men truly respecting her?

Are they truly OK with being one of many, one the night after?

Do they come back for sex or because they like her, or both?

And... I guess your opinion on all this.

I don't intend to share this with her.",1664046964,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/xn1g52/if_you_were_one_of_these_men_or_if_you_found_out/,askmen

1924,xmudkg,Hard to decide what to choose for the Future as my mind conflicts between what to choose," 

Hey Reddit of Men. I decided o ask this question as it should have men experienced with enough life to answer my question.

To give a bit of a background, I'm a junior year student in my Bachelors Degree for Computer Sciences.I am not from a rich background or so to say even an upper middle class,so I have decided my starting point to be in a job but can't decide the further steps. As someone said "" If you plan, plan till the end"", I don't want to be just a human being in this world and to add I don't want any answers telling that being average joe is ok or something similar b.s. . I want a life of luxury and riches and all the wealth and happiness but something inside me screams that I haven't even touched the thing that is needed for it.

My mind bounces between whether I should prepare for any prestigious government exams, or would continue in the job to get a hefty salary and a pair of glasses(considering the time I'll spend on PCs) , or go for MITs or Higher Education in the US and then get a high position in company or at last just join the army and let my soul be happy that atleast I died for my country.

I genuinely seek answers or atleast someone's life stories that let them decide what they wanted and what they did for it.",1664029904,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/xmudkg/hard_to_decide_what_to_choose_for_the_future_as/,askmen

1936,xmsvxc,How would you like your partner to initiate without kissing?,"
My boyfriend (25M) and I (27F) have very different sex drives. I am always initiating and I brought it up and he said sex always begins in the same way, we kiss for awhile then it goes to fondling/bj and sex so he finds it boring. I've asked what he would like then, and tried to dress up or be more spontaneous but he says well if you dress up and we start by making out again then it's the same soup, different outfit so to speak. He doesn't have any suggestions on how I can improve this and he doesn't typically initiate so it's hard to gauge what to do. Personally since I don't want to go all out and get rejected I'd go for a kiss to gauge whether he seems up for more but clearly that's not working. Other than spontaneously go for a bj, I really can't think of how to initiate intimacy without kissing, it feels like a pretty important part of it. How do your SOs initiate sex and how else would you like for things to be spiced up?

1957,xmp2sb,What do guys make of drunken texts saying I love you? I think I f*cked up!,"I have been seeing a guy since June up until recently. He’s an old flame who I used to date casually in my early 20’s and we reconnected. We’ve gone to two music festivals together and talked a good bit online, but otherwise I haven’t seen him in person because it’s long distance. 

We get on very well in person, but he’s been so hot and cold when we aren’t together. He was meant to come over and spend a weekend with me last week, but he bailed on plans at the last minute and said “his head wasn’t really in it at the moment” and “see what happens down the line I guess.” His reasons were that he needed a break from drinking and that he wasn’t able to put himself out there since his last relationship (abusive). Not sure whether to believe this or not. I’m confused because on that weekend he called me for hours and he seemed excited to go see me. 

Anyway, I took all that maturely at the time and said no worries, all good. Then a couple of days ago I went out, got drunk and voice noted him/ messaged him that I loved him, missed him etc etc. I was laughing at how stupid it was while drunk and he was responding very nicely. 

Next day when sober, I apologised and said I needed to get my shit together. He laughed about it and we talked for a bit before he let the convo fizzle out. 

I saw he turned off his “last active” on messenger last night (I presume he’s drinking), but does that mean he turned it off because he’s scared I’ll drunken message again? 

Basically, this guy must think I’m a psycho right? Have I ruined all chances of him ever wanting to see me again?

But the situation in my family is a bit complicated and I'm unsure how to navigate it and how to feel about it. 

I'm a 20 yo guy in college, my parents are about middle class, maybe a bit towards the lower end. The kicker is my granparents are very well off financially. However they are getting older and more dependent on us each day. While I'm at home I take most of that load. Be it driving them around, gardening, carrying and putting together stuff they bought, whatever else, there's always something that needs to be done and they're too old to do it but are not ready to calm down a bit and live a more ""old people"" life. 

I don't feel entitled to my grandparents giving me anything really but what confuses me is that they've done so much for my dad's brother and his side of the family. They put him on top of their company, thanks to that he now has his own house with a pool, two nice cars and they're just as well off. My dad feels left out and betreyed,  as he could have used that help just as much (and he asked for it). It's odd because he was around the whole time, helping, while his brother moved away at a young age and pursued his dreams i guess, which didn't work out as well as he hoped. 

Another thing that I can't get my head around is why they're discouraging me from doing honest work to make some money. I've been working over every break since 16, as I was never one to expect my parents to buy stuff for me. If I wanted a PC, a phone, a bike or whatever I'd buy it with my own money. I've been trying to save up for a car but since I'm in college now and spending a lot more then while I was living at home I haven't been able to save up for a half decent one yet. My granparents are against me working and saying things like ""you will work all your life, why are you in such a hurry"" and I'm like ""umm...because I've got no money and I'd like to have some?"". 
I think they think my parents should finance everything for me but I'm sure they know they're doing the most they can. I think they could really help out a bit and they wouldn't even notice it but for some reason they don't. But hey I have no right to expect anything from them, they don't owe me anything.

All of us 3 are the same grade but only the 2 of them are in the same section. One day their classmates are telling me that J have a crush on me so I invited J to go outside and eat. I invited her so that we both can know each other but I didn't feel that connection. She's always the first one on messaging me things like ""good morning/night"" ""take care"" ""did you enjoy your food?"" ""jgh, text me when you got home"" and etc, she's kind, but I can't vibe with her. I really can't tell why. 

On the other hand, CG is my crush since grade 5. Our hobbies are similar, I like her personality, I can vibe with her but I'm really scared that If I confess then I will lost our friendship that's why I'm going out with other girls before. 

But now I really want her but her bestfriend have a crush on me, what should I do? Should I just say to J that I don't like her? But that seems kinda harsh.

2044,xmcsas,(M30) How do I reignite lost passion?,"Now before I get straight to the point let me clarify that this post is not me feeling sorry for myself and rather a genuine request for suggestions. Any advice is appreciated.

Recently I came to realise that I’m no longer living my days, they just sort of fly by. I know I have stuff to do, but can’t bring myself to do it, like It’s an actual challenge. It’s not even trivial things like clean my room or finish old projects. I’ve received this ticket for traffic violation, that I could easily dispute thus saving myself over 100 pounds. Nah,  instead it’s just laying there, untouched for days. If I don’t pay it by Sunday, they threaten me with court proceedings. Still, weirdly enough I just kind of don’t care.
My typical day consist of me laying on my bed all day and watching youtube mostly. I do food and bathroom breaks and go to work when I’m booked (I have a very flexible outdoorsy job). I’m living in a shared house with 3 people that I barely talk to. 
I know that if I pushed myself I could get a very well paid job and move out to my own apartament and maybe even lease one. I am talented and very creative. I’ve recorded an album with my band that I’m really proud of and objectively could do really good - all I have to do is finish mixing it. I have an idea for an epic three part novel and a prequel for it - all I have to do is sit down and write it. I know about companies that are looking for people with my expertise and pay really well - all I have to do is make a CV and send it. I have all these amazing opportunities, but it’s like I’m trapped by myself. To do anything is like moving through molasses. Even writing this post is a chore.

I miss the magic times of my adolescence when I was crazily passionate about music and sound. I turned my room into a DIY studio and was racing through entire city on my bicycle to get to rehearsal space twice a week. Playing instruments every day, constantly thinking of new songs. I even learned basically of coding once and made a very basic game once to get an A in computer science in primary school. Really wish I could bring reignate that fire.

Anyone ever felt similar? How did you get through it? Any advice, strategy etc. would be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR - I waste away my days and potential, can’t bring myself to do anything, happy to take suggestions",1663975983,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/xmcsas/m30_how_do_i_reignite_lost_passion/,askmen

2056,xmbbbv,How do you fix a massive lack of self confidence?,"I've just completely ruined my last relationship because of this, and most of my relationships before because of that and other reasons. I was dating an absolutely wonderful, out of this world, woman, both mentally and physically, and I ruined everything because I just couldn't believe someone as awesome as her was sincerely attracted to a piece of crap like me.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't help but think I'm a massive w\*nker all the time, I can't find anything good to love about my self. I've done bad things, I've made the people I love feel like crap, the only way I can look confident is by pretending I am, and it's exhausting so I just don't do it anymore. Or when intoxicated, but then I become an a-hole.

&amp;#x200B;

Any tips?(btw I've seen tons of shrinks and took tons of different meds, it didn't help...)",1663972186,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/xmbbbv/how_do_you_fix_a_massive_lack_of_self_confidence/,askmen
